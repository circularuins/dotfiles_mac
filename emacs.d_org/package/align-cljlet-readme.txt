Description:

This program exists because I was tired of manually aligning let
statements in clojure.  This program is designed to quickly and
easily allow let forms to be aligned.  This is my first Emacs
Lisp program and as a result if probably less than optimal.  Feel
free to suggest improvements or send in patches.

This program was inspired by align-let.el although does not share
any of it's code.  I had considered altering align-let.el to
work correctly with Clojure however it was easiler to simply
start from scratch.
